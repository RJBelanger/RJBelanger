### About Me: 
Hello, my name is RJ Belanger. I am a Software Developer graduating from Eastern Washington University in March 2024, with a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Cyber Security. I'm actively seeking exciting career opportunities for post-graduation. During my internship at Kaiser Aluminium, I gained significant experience in Python, SQL, and managing large-scale data. A notable achievement was developing the Dynamic Lot Search application, which efficiently queries millions of records to display detailed lot information for inspection and data analysis. This experience, combined with my academic achievements and personal projects, makes me confident in succeeding in a graduate-level role.

In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, hiking, mountain biking, baking, and playing video games. As a hobby, I build computers, robots, and develop PC and mobile games whenever possible. Recently, I finished building the Nove Hexapod, which has 16 servos controlling 6 legs. I'm now working on programming it to dance, in addition to controlling its movements. My next project is a 3D-printed mechanical arm controlled by an Arduino. I am also continuing the development of my other video game projects listed below.

### Currently Learning: 
Machine Learning and Computer Vison

### Current Projects:
  ### -ARCTIC (Automated Range Creation Tool and Integrated Console)
  A capstone project developed with three teammates to assist in training the U.S. Army's
      1st Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) in cybersecurity. ARTCIC is an internal cyber range.
      We are developing a contained application that creates sudo users to simulate normal 
      network activity and executes red team actions using PowerShell scripts. It features a 
      Manager that logs and controls all sudo users in an OpenStack environment, reducing the 
      overhead of having the network activity and red team actions currently run by soldiers.

  ### -Raspberry pi 5 Ultumate Emulator 
  Software designed to emulate retro games on the Raspberry Pi 5.

### Completed Projects:
 ### -Dynamic Lot History Search
  As mentioned earlier, this is the project I'm most proud of. Developed during my
      internship, it went through the entire software development cycle and was rolled out to
      production, receiving both positive and constructive feedback. The application dynamically
      and efficiently queries millions of records to display detailed lot information,
      providing an overview of the data history at every station related to that original melt
      of metal and its child lots. It also links to accessible information about the lots, such
      as images and chemistry lab tests. The search dynamically adds new stations to the results.
      It was challenging and rewarding to evolve the product as I better understood the problem
      statement and addressed issues such as lot numbers rolling over after a certain number 
      amount of time , needing to be able to get a 6 digit and a 8 digit accurate lot search 
      results while also making the querries fast enough to be usable.got down to a run time of a
      Avg 4.5 secounds from originaly avg of 16 secounds.
      
 ### -Coles Cafe 
  A website I created using React to redesign the cafe website in our university's lobby. The
      focus was on front-end design, improving the overall flow of the website and organizing the
      online ordering experience to boost business.

 ### -Game Hub 
   A project I developed with two teammates using Python and Pygame. It features a retro UI
      main lobby where you can choose from five different games developed by our team. The games
      include Duck Hunt, Space Invaders, Ping Pong, Snake, and Tic Tac Toe. I was responsible for
      developing the main menu, Duck Hunt, and Ping Pong. Creating custom pixel art for Duck Hunt
      and the heads on the main screen was my favorite part. Getting the ducks to move across the
      screen as well as having the gun move to where your mouse is facing was an interesting challenge.
      
  All 5 Games Avalible:
      -Duck Hunt   -Space Invaders 
      -Ping Pong   -Snake   -Tik Tak Toe  

 ### -Cruse Control Simulation  
   C code developed to simulate a cruise control system on a TM12334322 chip from Texas
     Instruments. It displays speed in MPH, KPH, or the current cruise set speed on a peripheral
     board with a 7-segment display. The system can adjust speed up or down and displays the state
     of speed using LED program utalizes several debounced timers and some calls to assembly code.
     
 ### -Ticket Booking Airline  
   An airport ticket booking simulation built in Java utilizing a hashmap to track seat
      availability on flights. This project was developed using test-driven design, implementing
      JUnit tests. Will give it your seat seat number you wish to book and it will determine seat 
      availability and return the result.

 ### -Freenova Hexapod spider example code  
  example control code for the Hexapod and my code for silly spider dance
